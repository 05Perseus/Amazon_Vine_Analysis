## *Conclusion*
There appears to be no bias towards 5 star reviews by paid review leavers. There were more 5 star reviews as a % of total reviews in the unpaid population.

An additional analysis to determine differences in the program would be the helpful review votes. It would be good to know the differences in the quality of the reviews of those who were paid to review and those who weren't.
